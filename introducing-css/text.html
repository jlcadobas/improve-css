        <h1> Podcast Review: Investigate Your Dark Side to <br> take control of your life </h1>
        
        <section>
            <p> The podcast starts as usual with <em> Dr. Jordan Peterson </em> introducing his guest named <em> Robert Greene </em>
                whom is an American author writing about power, strategy and seduction. </p>    

            <p> Peterson mentions that he was curious about the motivations of writing the guest's laws-books, which also 
                garnered a questionable response to the readers, despite having sold million copies with readers who also 
                resonated a lot with the books. </p>

            <p> Greene started to explain that he had been in a lot of jobs, some of which he enjoyed and others seemed to
                have been overly politicized, causing him to change jobs a lot of times. </p>
            
            <p> He stresses that there are environments on those job that he had observed where there's a lot of manipulation
                tactics going on in which he found appaling and interesting. In addition, he explains that providing those 
                knowledge through his books would be comforting to people who suffers in an environment of power-tripping and
                manipulation. It is also worth mentioning that those dark sides are also within us, and it is worth exploring.
                As Dr. Peterson mentions that the book is also about shadow exploration, regarding to those terms in psychology
                studied upon by the likes of Jung and Freud. </p>

            <p> Furthermore, Dr. Peterson also emphasized his curiosity in Greene's personality in relation to his motivations
                on writing his books. He mentioned that Greene seems to be a highly agreeable person and that people who are like
                that are easy targets for manipulators, cheats and douchebags.  </p> 

            <p> Green goes on to provide more examples in the workplace in which the politicking and manipulation was rampant.
                Dr. Peterson then supplements Greene's idea, talking about the clients he had talking about their careers. </p>
